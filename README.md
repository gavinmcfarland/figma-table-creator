# Table Creator

A simple Figma plugin for creating flexible and editable tables.

## Creating a table

2. Click create.

## Selecting rows/columns

1. Select one or more frames/cells inside a row or column.
2. Select `Table Creator > Select columns/rows`.

__Please note__ when you make your selection it must be inside a group or frame which is parallel to other groups or frames. In some cases the plugin may select objects or frames you didn't expect. If you want to exclude certain layers or objects from being selected you can include `[ignore]` in the layer name.
